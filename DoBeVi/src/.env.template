# ========== Project Configuration (.env.template) ==========
# ⚠️ Copy this file as .env before running the project
# ⚙️ All variables are prefixed with DOBEVI_

# --- Path to your Lean repo (absolute path required)
DOBEVI_REPO_PATH=/absolute/path/to/lean/repo
# Default: /absolute/path/to/lean/repo
# Description: Absolute path to the root of the Lean project repository.
# Note: This repo should be built successfully with `lake build` before running evaluation.

# --- Path to the Lean file inside the repo (relative to REPO_PATH)
DOBEVI_FILE_PATH=relative/path/to/lean/file
# Default: relative/path/to/lean/file
# Description: Relative path to the Lean theorem file to be used.

# --- Path to the model (HuggingFace model name or local checkpoint path)
DOBEVI_MODEL_PATH=path/to/model
# Default: path/to/model
# Description: Path to the LLM model used for tactic generation.

# --- Search algorithm name
DOBEVI_ALGORITHM=best_first
# Default: best_first
# Allowed: best_first, group_score, internlm_bfs, layer_dropout
# Description: Proof search strategy used by the engine. 
#   - 'best_first' is the default search algorithm.
#   - 'group_score' is the ineffective scoring function mentioned in Appendix A.5 of the paper.
#   - 'internlm_bfs' is used for evaluating InternLM-2.5-Prover since it requires ohter parameters during search.
#   - 'layer_dropout' is the adaptive beam size strategy described in the paper.

# --- Number of worker processes
DOBEVI_NUM_WORKERS=32
# Default: 32
# Description: Number of parallel prover worker processes for tree search. 
# The recommended value is 8 times the number of GPUs available.

# --- Number of GPUs to allocate
DOBEVI_NUM_GPUS=4
# Default: 4
# Description: Number of GPUs available for the model. Each model will use one GPU.

# --- Number of tactics to sample per state (i.e. beam size)
DOBEVI_NUM_SAMPLED_TACTICS=4
# Default: 4
# Description: How many tactics to generate at each search step.
# In adaptive beam size strategy, this is the maximum number of tactics to sample.

# --- Timeout for the entire proof search (seconds)
DOBEVI_SEARCH_TIMEOUT=1800
# Default: 1800 (30 minutes)
# Description: Time limit for one full proof search attempt.

# --- Maximum number of node expansions
DOBEVI_MAX_EXPANSIONS=600
# Default: 600
# Description: Maximum expansions allowed during the tree search process.
# We set thie to 600 in our experiments and if it is set to `None`, the search will continue until the timeout is reached.

# --- Path to save the proof search results
DOBEVI_RESULT_SAVE_PATH=../results
# Default: ../results
# Description: Folder path to save proof logs or final results.
